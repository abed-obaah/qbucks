## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash

   cd project-directory

   npm install OR YARN INSTALL
expo start or npm run android

## the endpoint for login was throwing 409 error at the time of publish and sometimes the register endpoint does the same too. and the endpoint doesnt accept full number on registration, the number must be 6 and the password too otherwise the 409 error comes up. Another keynote, the "post" endpoint didnt work, 404 error not found from the express server even after testing on postman but the "get" endpoint works fine. dont knpow if it was the server or the logic behind the endpoint. and a simulation of wallet funding was added which saves to the storage for 365 days untill wiped.
